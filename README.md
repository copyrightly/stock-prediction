# stock-prediction

Given the dataset of stock prices in the past, we build a lstm model to predict the the change in the following week (5 buisiness days). It will predict how much the price will change compared with the current price, like +5%, +3%, +2%, -2%, -3% or -5%.

The basic structure of the model is based on the following tutorial:\\
